🚢 Titanic Dataset - Data Analysis & Prediction

This project is a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling task on the famous Titanic dataset.
It was created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world data, perform analysis,
visualize insights, and apply predictive modeling techniques.
